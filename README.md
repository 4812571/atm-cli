# `atm-cli`: Tools for Generating and Working with MIDI Files

## Overview

`atm-cli` is a command line tool for generating and working with MIDI files. It was purpose-built for
All the Music, LLC to assist in its mission to enable musicians to make all of their music
without the fear of frivolous copyright lawsuits. All code is freely available under the
[Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
If you're looking for a Rust library to generate and work with MIDI files, check out
[the `libatm` project](https://github.com/allthemusicllc/libatm), on which this tool relies. For
more information on All the Music, check out [allthemusic.info](http://allthemusic.info).  For more detailed
information about the code, check out the crate documentation [here](https://allthemusicllc.github.io/atm-cli/atm/index.html).

## Installation

`atm-cli` is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and thus requires the Rust toolchain to compile.
Follow the instructions at <https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install> to install the toolchain.
Once that is complete, clone the repo and compile the tool:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/allthemusicllc/atm-cli.git
$ cd atm-cli
$ git submodule update --init
$ cargo build --release
$ cargo run --release -- -h # show usage
```

## Getting Started

To generate a single MIDI file from a melody, use the `gen single` directive:

```bash
atm gen single 'C:4,D:4,E:4,F:4,G:4,A:4,B:4,C:5' test.mid
```

To brute-force generate a range of melodies from a set of notes and with a given length, use one of the `gen *` directive.
The example below will output the melodies to a Gzip-compressed Tar file, with a directory structure that guarantees no more
than 4,096 files per directory.

```bash
atm gen tar-gz -p 2 'C:4,D:4,E:4,F:4,G:4,A:4,B:4,C:5' 8 C4_D4_E4_F4_G4_A4_B4_C5.tar
```

After generating a range of melodies with one of the `gen *` directives (beside `gen single`), use the `partition` directive
to determine which directory a particular melody was written to.

```bash
atm partition -p 2 'C:4,C:4,C:4,C:4,C:4,C:4,C:4,C:5'
```

## Usage

```bash
atm 0.3.0
All The Music, LLC
Tools for generating and working with MIDI files. This app was created as part of an effort to generate by brute-force
billions of melodies, and is tailored for that use case

USAGE:
    atm <SUBCOMMAND>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

SUBCOMMANDS:
    estimate     Estimate output size of storage backends to help make informed decisions about which to use
    gen          Generate melodies (MIDI files) and store them in a file/files
    help         Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
    partition    Generate the partition(s) for a MIDI pitch sequence within a partitioning scheme. If no partition
                 depth is provided, will default to a depth of 1
```
