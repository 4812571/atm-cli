# atm-cli

## Overview

`atm-cli` is a command line tool for generating and working with MIDI files. It was purpose-built for
All the Music, LLC to assist in its mission to enable musicians to make all of their music
without the fear of frivolous copyright lawsuits. All code is freely available under the

If you're looking for a Rust library to generate and work with MIDI files, check out
[the `libatm` project](https://github.com/allthemusicllc/libatm), on which this tool relies. For
more information on All the Music, check out [allthemusic.info](http://allthemusic.info).  For more detailed

## Installation

`atm-cli` is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and thus requires the Rust toolchain to compile.  Follow the instructions at <https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install> to install the toolchain.  Once that is complete, clone the repo and compile the tool:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/allthemusicllc/atm-cli.git
$ cd atm-cli
$ git submodule update --init
$ cargo build --release
$ cargo run --release -- -h # show usage
```

## Getting Started

To generate a single MIDI file from a melody, use the `single` directive:

```bash
atm single -n 'C:4,D:4,E:4,F:4,G:4,A:4,B:4,C:5' -t test.mid
```

To brute-force a range of melodies with a given length, generated from a given input note sequence, use the `batch` directive:

```bash
atm batch -n 'C:4,D:4,E:4,F:4,G:4,A:4,B:4,C:5' -L 8 -b 20 -p 2 -t C4_D4_E4_F4_G4_A4_B4_C5.tar
```

After brute-force generating a range of melodies with the `batch` command, lookup the output batch for note sequence with the `partition` directive:

```bash
atm partition -n 'C:4,C:4,C:4,C:4,C:4,C:4,C:4,C:5' -p 2
```
