initSidebarItems({"struct":[["BatchTarFile","Nested tar archive storage backend, where each entry in the archive is a  gzip-compressed tar archive containing MIDI files. Use for the largest datasets where compression, or output file size, is of the utmost importance. Choosing a batch size (and compression level) such that each compressed tar archive aligns with 512 bytes will ensure that no space is wasted in the top-level archive. For example, if a batch size of 25 compresses to 515 bytes, then each entry will take `1,536` bytes (512 for header plus 1024 for data). However, if a batch compresses to 510 bytes, then each entry will take 1024 bytes, with only 2 bytes extra. Keep in mind that higher compression levels will reduce throughput of the program."]]});
